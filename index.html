            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hey there! Welcome to my humble online CV. My name is Pavlína, but friends call me Paja. On the following few paragraphs I will tell you a bit about me and myself only.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="aboutMe" class="about_me paragraph dark">
            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I was born in a city named Olomouc and so far I still live here. I got my masters degree here - on Palacky University. Originally I always wanted to work in IT (don´t ask me why). But things happen and eventually I got my degree from physics. Specifically instrumental and apllied physics. During my physics studies (uff!) I also did some programming. A litle bit of Matlab, a tiny bit of C and some LabVIEW. LabVIEW I really liked. I finished both of my thesis in LabVIEW. I even wanted to get a Ph.D., but later I realized that I prefer something else.</p>
            <p>In this part I will tell you a bit about my work experience. Let´s say I skip all the summer jobs in florist´s, pubs and camps and pounce directly to my main (and one and only) job. I work as development technologist in Meopta - Optika s. r. o. Well, technically my position is called thin layers desinger, but since noone (except some nerds maybe..) can imagine what that means, I decided to stick with development technologist. But since I already brought that up... Thin layers designer is a person, who desings thin layers (WOW! Right?) But seriously.. Thin layers - meaning really thin, like in the nanometer range, are manufactured to improve both physical and endurance properties. Thin layer, or thin film, can for example make an optical part more reflective or more scratch resistant. As the most commont thing you can think of is for example a mirror or glasses. I personally work on a bit more complicated layers - for <abbr title="Infrared">IR</abbr> light. Layers for this part of spectrum are more thick - meaning we are now in micrometers. The main use of layers for IR is probably for an army purposes. And because of that, I can´t really tell you more about my job.. :)<br>
            For those who want to learn more about this field, check auntie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_optics">Wiki</a>.</p>
            <p>Anyway... as time went on, I realized more and more, that even though my job is pretty interesting, I miss creating codes. Of course I had literally least of experiance I could have, but I really enjoyed that kind of work. I knew, I had to improve. So I found some courses done by <a href="https://www.czechitas.cz/cs/" target="blank">Czechitas</a> and gave it a shot. I´ve learned some coding in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. At the moment I only know the fundamentals. But I´m trying to learn as much as my free time lets me. I´m also trying to add some JavaScript, so my future web sites won´t look so boring.
            I would be very pleased if everything works out well and I can grow into a succesful web developer.</p>

        <div id="contact" class="contact_ paragraph">
            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>There are several ways to contant me. You can always try to yell my name and hope I´ll hear it, but though my hearing is pretty good, I wouldn´t count on it. The easiest and pretty reliable way to contact me is via my e-mail adress. That can be easily done by clicking <a href="mailto:pavlinagerslova@seznam.cz">here</a>. Or, if you are a talkative one, you can reach me through a mobile phone. So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_XBRUY3Vqc&ab_channel=InThisMoment">call me!</a> (<em>This link serves only for pleasing an ear. No offers have been made.</em>)</p>
