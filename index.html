            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hey there! Welcome to my humble online CV. My name is Pavlína Geršlová. On the following few paragraphs I will tell you a bit about me and myself only.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="About_me" class="About_me Paragraph Dark">
            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I was born in a city named Olomouc and so far, I still live here. I got my masters degree here - on Palacký University. Originally I always wanted to work in IT (don´t ask me why). But things happen and eventually I got my degree from physics. Specifically instrumental and apllied physics. During my physics studies (uff!) I also did some programming. A litle bit of Matlab, a tiny bit of C and some LabVIEW. LabVIEW I really liked, but unfortunaly I couldn´t find a place to actually use it. I even wanted to get a Ph.D., but later I realized, that I prefer something else.</p>
            <p>This is the part where I tell you a bit about my work experience. Let´s say I skip all the summer jobs in florist´s, pubs and camps and pounce directly to my main (and one and only) job. I work as development technologist in Meopta - Optika s. r. o. Well, technically my position is called thin layers desinger, but since noone (except some nerds maybe..) can imagine what that means, I decided to stick with development technologist. But since I already brought that up... Thin layers designer is a person, who desings thin layers (WOW! Right?) But seriously..</p>
            <p>I´ve learned coding in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in <a href="https://www.czechitas.cz/cs/" target="blank">Czechitas</a>.<br>
            At the moment I only know the fundamentals. But I´m trying to learn as much as my free time lets me. I´m also trying to add some JavaScript, so my future web sites won´t look so boring.<br>
            I would be very pleased if everything works out well and I can grow into a succesful web developer.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Contact" class="Contact Paragraph">
            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>There are several ways to contant me. You can always try to yell my name and hope I´ll hear it, but though my hearing is pretty good, I wouldn´t count on it. The easiest and pretty reliable way to contact me is via my e-mail adress. That can be easily done by clicking <a href="mailto:pavlinagerslova@seznam.cz">here</a>. Or, if you are a talkative one, you can reach me through a mobile phone. So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_XBRUY3Vqc&ab_channel=InThisMoment">call me!</a> (<em>This link serves only for pleasing an ear. No offers have been made.</em>)</p>
